# Javascript Projects
A collection of projects I created through the Codecademy course, [**Create a Front-End App with React**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-web-apps-with-react).

<br/>

### A few of the course objectives are:
- [x] **Build Interactive Web Apps** - Use JavaScript and React to build polished experiences that will stand out.
- [x] **Understand the React Library** - Create dynamic websites with one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks.
- [x] **Use and Call APIs** - Make your apps more powerful by leveraging other websitesâ€™ code with APIs.
